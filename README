This is a set of scripts for working with genome assemblies, making GC-cov blobs, extracting reads belonging to the blobs, etc

A full pipeline will be published here soon. Please get in touch with sujai.kumar@ed.ac.uk for any help.

For now, this is how you use these scripts with clc:
1. First, create adapter/quality trimmed, interleaved read files:
eg one for each library:
 interleaved_lib1.fastq (lib1_1/1, lib1_1/2, lib1_2/1, lib1_2/2, lib1_3/1, lib1_3/2,...)
 interleaved_lib2.fastq

2. Create preliminary assembly:

  clc_novo_assemble \
    -q interleaved_lib1.fastq interleaved_lib1.fastq \
    -o prelim_assembly.fna

or, you could use SOAP denovo with a low kmer (eg 23 or 25) to get prelim_assembly.fna

3. Map reads back to preliminary assembly:

  clc_novo_assemble_long \
    -q interleaved_lib1.fastq interleaved_lib1.fastq \
    -d prelim_assembly.fna \
    -o prelim_assembly.fna.cas

or, you could run an aligner like BWA with the interleaved reads mapped back to prelim_assembly.fna and the output stored in sam or bam format.

4. Create gc-cov plots and files and insert size distribution plots and files

  clc_len_cov_gc.pl -c prelim_assembly.fna.cas
  clc_pairing.pl    -c prelim_assembly.fna.cas

or, if you have a sam format file:

  sam_len_cov_gc_pairing.pl -s file.sam -c prelim_assembly.fna [-o outputprefix]

or, if you have a bam format file:

  sam_len_cov_gc_pairing.pl -s <(samtools view file.bam) -c prelim_assembly.fna [-o outputprefix]

In all cases (clc/sam/bam alignment formats) these files are created:
- scatterplots of gc vs coverage, length vs coverage, and gc vs length
- a fasta file with the same sequences as prelim_assembly.fna but with modified headers that store the length, coverage and gc value in the headers.

This modified prelim_assembly.lencovgc.fna file can be used to pull out contig ids that meet a certain criterion.

Steps 5 onwards will be added later, and will describe how to pull out the reads that map to those contigs.
